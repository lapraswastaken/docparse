Welcome to ReDocparse's documentation!
======================================

ReDocparse is a small library that aims to make transforming large amounts of text easier.

It introduces a :class:`~redocparse.matcher.Matcher` class that matches a chunk of text via regex,
 runs the matched text through an optional callback function,
 then sends the matched text through each of its nested Matchers.

In short, it's a more ergonomic way to use regex recursively.
